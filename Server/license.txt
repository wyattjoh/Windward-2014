For all the code there is no license - you can do whatever you want with it. If 
you like it, we ask that you say something nice about Windward with a link to 
www.windward.net.

The U.I. icons came from www.iconexperience.com and you must buy their icons
to use them in anything else. They have really good icons and their prices are
reasonable so do purchase if you want to use their stuff.

The art for the cars, terrain, and roads came from http://blackmoondev.com
(paid for by Windward) - you can use it any way you wish.

thanks - dave
